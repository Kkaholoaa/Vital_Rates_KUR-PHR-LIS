#df = df for the independent variable (the number of levels in the variable minus 1),
#df residuls = df for the residuals (the total number of observations minus one and minus the number of levels in the independent variables).
#sumsq = the total variation between the group means and the overall mean).
#mean sq = Mean Sq column is the mean of the sum of square
#f-value = from f test, The larger the F value, the more likely it is that the variation caused by the independent variable is real and not due to chance.
#Pr(>F) = p-value of f stat. how likely it is that the F-value calculated from the test would have occurred if the null hypothesis of no difference among group means were true.

#two way anova, incorporating density AND fertilizer
two.way <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer + density, data = crop.data)

summary(two.way)
#when adding the density to it, we noticed that the sum sq went down, meaning that there is now less
#variation between group means and the overall mean.

#testing interaction
interaction <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer*density, data = crop.data)

summary(interaction)
#after testing the interaction between our two variables, we noticed that the sum sq is really low with a low f value
# I would hypothesize that this means that density has no effect on fertilizer. 
#not much variation that can be explained by the interaction between fertilizer and planting density.

#adding a blocking/ confounding variable (variable that cannot be explained)
blocking <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer + density + block, data = crop.data)

summary(blocking)
#we notice a low f-value and a low pvalue for our f statistic, meaning that there probably arent any confounding variables
#not affecting how much variation in the dependent variable they explain.

#Post-Hoc

#ANOVA tells us if there are differences among group means, but not what the differences are. 
#To find out which groups are statistically different from one another,  perform a tukey post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons:

tukey.two.way<-TukeyHSD(two.way)

tukey.two.way

#differences seem to be mostly between fertilizer treatments 3 and 1 (makes sense)
#3-1 and 3-2 are statistically significant (p-value > 0.05)
#2-1 are not statistically significant (p=0.44)

##########################################

#plot them!!
#When plotting the results of a model, it is important to display:

#the raw data
#summary information (mean and standard error)
#letters or symbols above each group being compared to indicate the groupwise differences.

#from anova, we know density and fertilizer are sig. in plant size
#To display this information on a graph, 
#we need to show which of the combinations of fertilizer type + planting density are statistically different from one another.

tukey.plot.aov<-aov(yield ~ fertilizer:density, data=crop.data)

tukey.plot.test<-TukeyHSD(tukey.plot.aov)

#differences are mostly between 3 and 1

#Report results!

#We found a statistically-significant difference in average crop yield by 
#both fertilizer type (f(2)=9.018, p < 0.001) and 
#by planting density (f(1)=15.316, p<0.001).

#A Tukey post-hoc test revealed that fertilizer mix 3 resulted in a higher yield on 
#average than fertilizer mix 1 (0.59 bushels/acre), and a higher yield on average than 
#fertilizer mix 2 (0.42 bushels/acre). Planting density was also significant, with planting 
#density 2 resulting in an higher yield on average of 0.46 bushels/acre over planting density 1.

#A subsequent groupwise comparison showed the strongest yield gains at planting density 2, 
#fertilizer mix 3, suggesting that this mix of treatments was most advantageous for crop growth 
#under our experimental conditions.
